### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MartÃ­n, a.k.a n3m1.sys on Internet. I'm a cybersecurity consultant and ethical hacker.

### What do I do?

I do not program very frequently. Sometimes I develop exploit scripts, and simple programs to automate things.

### Projects

In Github you may find some old college projects and a few exploits. Since I decided to avoid using Microsoft products and platforms as much as I can I decided to migrate my projects to my personal git server at https://git.martecyber.com/. I will not remove anything I have here at the moment but I may do it in the future.

Here are a few of the exploits a developed.
