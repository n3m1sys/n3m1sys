### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is MartÃ­n, I'm a computer science engineering student at the National University of Distance Education (UNED) in Spain.

### What do I do?

I'm getting specialized in cybersecurity, but I'm also interested in many other fields of Computer Science, like quantum computing and algorithms. I'm a hacker, not one of those hoddie wearing criminals, but a person who likes to learn how things are made and how do they work.
