### Hi there 👋

My name is Martín, a.k.a n3m1.sys on Internet. I'm a cybersecurity consultant and ethical hacker.

### What do I do?

I do not program very frequently. Sometimes I develop exploit scripts, and simple programs to automate things.

### Projects

In Github you may find some old college projects and a few exploits. 

Here are a few of the exploits a developed.
